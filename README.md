# CSE540-GroupProject
Description: This project implements a blockchain-based supply chain provenance system using Solidity and Hardhat. It ensures transparency and traceability in product movement by recording creation, ownership transfer, and delivery updates on the blockchain. The system allows manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to maintain verifiable product records throughout the supply chain. This project also provides the important ability for people to openly track the sales of specific products on the blockchain. Many online retail marketplaces do not provide this data access, making it extremely hard for manufacturers to see the sales figures of products other than their own. This allows for a truly open marketplace where product sales figures can be collected and analyzed in order to make more informed product marketing and development decisions.
